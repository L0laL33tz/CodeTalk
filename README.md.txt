#What is ROT13?

ROT13 is an easy-to-use encryption mechanism which was popular in Usenet in the early 1980s, that was applied to veil the punch lines of jokes. The idea was to protect users from reading things they did not want to read, opposing spoilers. 

With Twitter speech censorship on the rise, ROT13 is a great way to state your opinions without going to Twitter jail, as the Twitter algorithm does not detect ROT13 encrypted statements as offensive speech.

#How to use ROT13

ROT13 rotates letters of the Latin alphabet by 13 places and is for that reason practical to apply on Twitter, as texts are not prolonged by its encryption, as opposed to other encryption mechanisms, as the NATO phonetic alphabet.
